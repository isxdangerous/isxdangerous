**Trees** are very tall [plants](/plants) that like to live together as forests. They are made of wood and leaves.

Trees don't do too much, to be honest. They eat sunlight and other [minerals](/minerals) to turn themselves into bigger trees.

During some parts of the year, they produce [pollen](/plants/pollen) for reproductive purposes, and depending on the tree, their pollen may or may not trigger an allergic reaction.

Also, sometimes they fall over. If they do falling over near you, and you are in the way of where they fall over, you may get hurt.

Because they don't do too much but are big and might trigger allergic reactions, we consider trees to be **a tiny bit dangerous**.
