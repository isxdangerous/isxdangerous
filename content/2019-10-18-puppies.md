**Puppies** are small baby [dogs](/animals/dogs). They are usually very cute. Puppies are the dog equivalent of [kittens](/animals/kittens).

Puppies present some low-key threats by nature of being small and active. For example, you may trip over them when they pass underfoot.

To understand the amount of danger a puppy represents, you must consider your relationship to the puppy. If you are only encountering it casually, you may have little or no reason to be afraid. If, on the other hand, you are [responsible](/ideas/responsibilities) for its well-being, you should consider the puppy as a slightly greater threat.

Once you adopt or otherwise take charge of a puppy, you will need to consider that it has needs which necessarily supercede your own: you must take it on walks, make sure it [eats](/activities/eating) good food that encourages it to grow, and clean up its [poops](/minerals/poop). If it lives in your [house](/places/houses), you may need to be aware that the puppy might destroy or degrade some or all of your [furniture](/minerals/furniture), due to its propensity for [mischief](/activities/mischief).

Lastly, puppies have a tendency to reduce their observers to drooling idiots. Their cuteness represents some threat to reasoned, articulate [discourse](/ideas/discourse).

In our final analysis, puppies are **very slightly dangerous**, especially if you are at risk of becoming responsible for one.
