**Millennials** are [people](/animals/people) born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. The idea is that they're basically all young adults, and are mostly distinguished by growing up alongside [the internet](/ideas/the-internet). As a result, popular [discourse](/ideas/discourse) tends to insist that the economic effects of an increasingly internet-based global economy characterized by heightened and accelerating wealth inequality are in fact the doings of millennials. This doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, but if you are a traditional industry or the existence of a middle class, you may feel threatened by the existence of millennials.

Most millennials' [parents](/animals/parents) are [boomers](/animals/boomers).

Some of the things millennials are actually responsible for are [Facebook](/ideas/facebook), a mainstream culture that approves of video games, a resurgence of [American](/places/america) interest in [democratic socialism](/ideas/socialism), and declining sales for some valueless status symbols. Some things millennials are not responsible for are [Google](/ideas/google), [smartphones](/minerals/phones), the [internet](/ideas/the-internet), and religion.

Look: it's mostly a matter of perspective. Like any group of people, millennials have done all sorts of thingsâ€”good and bad, dangerous and safe. We mostly feel that millennials as a group are only dangerous to established social and economic patterns that aren't compatible with the lives of disappointed but interconnected young adults living in a globalized [capitalist](/ideas/capitalism) economy helmed by people who see no reason to adjust their operating principles despite the looming threats of [global warming](/activities/global-warming) and international social unrest.

All in all, we consider millennials to be **dangerous in some directions**.
