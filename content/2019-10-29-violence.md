**Violence** is when a [person](/animals/people), a group of people, or another [animal](/animals) attempts to hurt another of one of those things. They may use [guns](/minerals/guns), [discourse](/ideas/discourse), [financial](/ideas/money) aggressions, or any number of other means to enact that hurt.

Regardless of their method, the aim is the same, which is to create danger.

Violence is **one hundred percent danger**â€”that is the entire point of what it is.
