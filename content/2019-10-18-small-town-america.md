**Small-town America** is a place where not a lot of [people](/animals/people) live, even though it feels like it is most of [America](/places/america). In fact, most of America is a [highway](/minerals/highways), a [tree](/plants/trees), or a [grass](/plants/grass). Most people live in [cities](/places/cities). About 80% of Americans live in non-rural areas, even though cities only cover about 4% of land in America.

Rural America is known (especially internationally) for its interest in [guns](/minerals/guns) and [religion](/ideas/religion), but only the latter is commonly in use. While guns are ever-present, they are largely being used to project [masculinity](/ideas/masculinity) and, in some cases, to do violence because of [racism](/ideas/racism). 

In fact, the most dangerous part of small-town America is the fact that people who are born there enjoy or envision few opportunities to leave and do something aside from what their parents do (or heroin).

Because small-town America is generally quiet and uneventful, it is **not that dangerous**. However, its tendency to stifle curiosity and kill ambition (as well as its tendency towards limiting ideas) merit a danger score that is higher than 0.
