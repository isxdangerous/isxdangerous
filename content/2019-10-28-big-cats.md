**Big cats** are [cats](/animals/cats) that are big. Almost all of them are [wild animals](/animals/wild-animals), except those that are in zoos. Regardless of whether or not they are in zoos, big cats are much larger than normal cats, and are all carnivorous apex predators who primarily eat other animals.

Big cats are scary in almost every possible way. They are remorseless killers. Some are very fast runners (notably cheetahs) and some are good climbers (like leopards) who hang out in trees. If a big cat is cross with you and there are no barriers between it and you, it is pretty likely that you will die.

Another kind of big cat is a lion. Lions, also, are very good at killing you when they want to.

If you see a big cat, try not to get close to it, attempt to pet it, or offer it any category of treats or toys. For safety reasons, you should probably remove yourself from the situation as quickly as you can without drawing attention to yourself.

We actually don't feel like we have to say a lot about this to get our point across. Big cats are **about as dangerous as it gets**.
