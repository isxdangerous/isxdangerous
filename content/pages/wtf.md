**Is X Dangerous** is an attempt to [catalog the world's dangers](/). It is made and maintained by the Is X Dangerous editorial board.

None of the information on this [website](/ideas/websites) is necessarily accurate or useful. It is, possibly, a work of [satire](/ideas/satire).

What you do, of course, is up to you, but it's not probably all that good an [idea](/ideas) to make any decisions on the basis of what you read here. 

All or most of our images are courtesy of the wonderful [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), for which we are highly grateful.

If you are aware of a danger we have not covered, please feel free to write about it and submit your estimation of its danger, along with your rationale, to [isxdangerous@gmail.com](mailto:isxdangerous@gmail.com).
