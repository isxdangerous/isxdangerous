**Astrology** is the practice of predicting the future on the basis of where [planets](/minerals/planets), stars, and [the moon](/minerals/the-moon) are. At least, that's what we think it is. We're honestly not totally sure.

Lots of smart [people](/animals/people) used to believe in astrology. Today, it's experiencing a resurgence, especially among [millennial](/animals/millennials) women. It's sort of unclear if they legitimately believe in astrology or if it's just for fun.

But it's also unclear if it's real! Do the positions and relationships of heavenly bodies have any bearing on our behavior or the circumstances that face us? It seems like a big question. I mean, maybe they do! But it's also pretty likely, based on the vagueness of most astrological predictions, that they don't, or that we don't really understand them.

Because we really don't get it, and we don't have a lot of confidence that it isn't real even though it seems like it probably isn't, we're shrugging and saying astrology is **medium dangerous**.
