He was a [boomer](/animals/boomers) He passed away in October 2011 of complications related to [pancreatic cancer](/activities/cancer). It is unlikely, but possible, that his health problems were exacerbated by [eating](/activities/eating) too many [bananas](/plants/bananas)â€”we aren't really the right people to ask about that.
