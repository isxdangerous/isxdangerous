**Bananas** are a kind of berry, which you can [eat](/activities/eating). They grow on a special kind of [tree](/plants/trees) which is called a "banana tree."

Bananas are a good source of some nutrients, and are highly regarded for their abundance of [potassium](/minerals/potassium). [Google](/ideas/google) suggests that the average banana has about 12% of the potassium a [person](/animals/people) needs in a day.

Some people are allergic to bananas, and for these people, bananas are very slightly dangerous. If you think you are allergic to bananas, you might want to talk to a [doctor](/animals/doctors) about whether or not you should eat them. We don't know.

Can you eat too many? At one point, some members of the editorial board thought they remembered that the actor who played [Steve Jobs](/animals/steve-jobs) almost died from eating a banana-rich diet. Steve Jobs actually died of [pancreatic cancer](/activities/cancer), which may or may not be related. Regardless, it seems like you would have to eat *way* too many bananas to put yourself in this position. That's actually why we made this website in the first place, and why our logo is a banana.

For most people, bananas are **not dangerous** unless you eat nothing but bananas or are allergic.
