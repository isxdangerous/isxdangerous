**Dogs** are adult [puppies](/animals/puppies). They are furry, weigh between just a handful of ounces and like, 400 pounds, and have some teeth inside their mouths. Some dogs are [domesticated](/animals/pets) and some are [not](/animals/wild-animals).

How dangerous a dog is depends on a variety of factors. A poorly trained, abused, or wild dog may be more likely to attack you, and that might even result in you contracting [rabies](/activities/rabies). Most domesticated dogs, on the other hand, just want pets or walks. 

If you find yourself in the position of having to fight a dog, it's probably best to try to get it to calm down by ignoring it and then slowly walking away. Hurting a dog sounds mean, even if they started it. Also, some dogs are trained by [the cops](/animals/cops) to find you or hurt youâ€”these are even worse than the wild kind.

However, if you encounter a domesticated pet dog, you might be able to pet it (ask whichever [human](/animals/people) it seems to be attached to), which might be quite pleasant.

Because dogs vary in their dangers wildly between situations, we consider dogs to be **sort of dangerous**.
